# WP Metaboxes

## Implementation Facts

### Documentation is mostly generated by Chat GPT

The initial prompt below was created by me in 5 itterations. Then it was updated each time Chat GPT generated documentation to another class.

#### Prompt:

You act as a profecient php developer who develop a public library which will be used by thousands of developers worldwide.

You have written custom classes for WordPress metaboxes creation. You need to document your code now (classes, their properties and methods). You don't need to document code inside the methods but you must document each method, each property, each class.

Qualitative documentation:
- must follow DocBlocker best practices
- must be meaningful
- must not contain any obvious information (like notes wether is method/prop is public, abstract or final).
- must describe what method is intended to do, i.e. its purpose

Example of a bad documentation:
```
/**
 * Abstract method to register the metabox.
 */
abstract protected function register(): void;
```
In the example above documentor specifies that it is a method and one is abstract while both things are obvious from the method definition.

Example of a good documentation
```
/**
 * Registers the metabox.
 */
abstract protected function register(): void;
```
In the example above documentor specifies purpose of the method and keeps documentation not long but still absolutely meaningful.

Another example of a bad documentation:
```
/**
 * Metabox constructor.
 * Hooks into the 'current_screen' action to initialize the metabox when applicable.
 */
final protected function __construct()
{
    add_action( 'current_screen', fn() => $this->maybe_init() );
}
```
In the example above documentor reveals too much details, he describes what happens inside of the method. While "Metabox constructor." is absolutely enough to describe the constructor.

Another example of a good documentation:
```
/**
 * @var array Holds the metabox actions.
 */
private array $actions;
```
In the example above documentor provides meaningful information about the property.

Your code is below.

First class file:
```
namespace Cvy\WP\Metaboxes;
use \Cvy\WP\Metaboxes\Notices\NoticesManager;
use \Exception;

abstract class Metabox extends \Cvy\DesignPatterns\Singleton
{
  private array $actions;

  ...
}
```
